## [Caesar Cipher (...and Decipher)](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Project-Caesar-Cipher/blob/main/basic_projects/1_caesar_cipher.rb)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher):

"In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence."

## [Sub Strings](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Project-Caesar-Cipher/blob/main/basic_projects/2_sub_strings.rb)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring):

"A string-searching algorithm, sometimes called string-matching algorithm, is an algorithm that searches a body of text for portions that match by pattern."

## [Stock Picker](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Project-Caesar-Cipher/blob/main/basic_projects/3_stock_picker.rb)

From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/stock-picker):

"Takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0."

## [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Project-Caesar-Cipher/blob/main/basic_projects/4_bubble_sort.rb)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort):

"Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted."

## [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Ruby-projects/tree/main/tic-tac-toe)

# Not exactly OOP, because I don't understand it... will be fixed soon!

## [Mastermind](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Ruby-projects/tree/main/mastermind)

From [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>):
"The game is based on a paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows."
The game is played using:

1. a <b><i>decoding board</i></b>with a row of four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
2. <b><i>code pegs</i></b> of four different colors (violet, green, blue and yellow), which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and
3. <b><i>key pegs</i></b>, some colored red and some white, they will be placed in the small holes on the board and act as a feedback (if choice is wrong - they remain white, right - become red).

## [Hangman](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Ruby-projects/tree/main/hangman)

## [Connect Four](https://github.com/Anna-Gladush/Ruby-projects/tree/main/connect_four)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four):

"Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and in the Soviet Union, Gravitrips) is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens."
